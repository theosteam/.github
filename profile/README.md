# The OS Team

**Greetings from The OS Team!** We're excited to have you here.

## What We Do

We develop a variety of software, including:

- [**Operating Systems**](https://theosteam.github.io/lambdaos)
- [**Game Engines**](https://github.com/theosteam/godot) (Discontinued and moved [here](https://github.com/segadreamcast1/xenengine))
- **Complementary Software** to enhance our existing projects.

**You can checkout our projects [here](https://theosteam.github.io/projects)**

## How to Contribute

As all our software is open-source, community contributions are vital to our success. Here are several ways you can get involved:

- Commit changes through the `dev` branch.
- Test new software with your modifications.
- Allow others to test the modified software.
- Report any issues you encounter.
- Test software pushed to the `main` or `master` branch.
- Submit pull requests and wait for approval.

We look forward to collaborating with you, developer!
