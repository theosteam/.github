## Hello there!
***We are The OS Team***

We make software that includes:

- Operating systems (https://theosteam.github.io/lambdaos)
- Game engines (https://github.com/theosteam/godot)
- And other software to go alongside our already existing software

## Ways to contrbute
**Since all our software is open source, we needed a way to make our software better through the community**

Here is how you can contribute in different ways:
- Make sure the changes have been committed through the `dev` branch
- Test the new software with your changes
- Let others test the modified piece of software
- Make an issue
- Test the software pushed to the `main` or `master` branch
- Make a pull request and wait for approval

See you then, developer!
