### Welcome!
***Greetings from The OS Team!***

## We develop a variety of software, including:

- [Operating systems](https://theosteam.github.io/lambdaos)
- [Game engines](https://github.com/theosteam/godot)
- Plus other complementary software to enhance our existing projects.

## Ways to Contribute
**As all our software is open-source, community contributions are essential for improving it.**

## Here are several ways you can contribute:

  - Ensure changes are committed through the `dev` branch.
  - Test new software with your modifications.
  - Allow others to test the modified software.
  - Report issues encountered.
  - Test software pushed to the `main` or `master` branch.
  - Submit pull requests and await approval.

Looking forward to collaborating with you, developer!
